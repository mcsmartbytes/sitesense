# Notes
# - If you are not using Stripe yet, you can leave the Stripe vars empty.
# - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are set in both Vercel Preview and Production.
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY must remain server-only (never exposed to client).
# - For local dev, create `.env.local` in expenses_made_easy/ with these values.
