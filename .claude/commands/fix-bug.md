# Fix Bug

Help me fix a bug in the Expenses Made Easy app.

**Context**: This is a React Native/Expo app with Supabase backend.

## Diagnostic Process

1. **Understand the Issue**
   - What's the error message?
   - Which screen/feature is affected?
   - Does it happen in Business, Personal, or both modes?
   - When did it start happening?

2. **Check Common Issues**
   - Business/Personal profile filtering
   - Supabase queries and RLS policies
   - Navigation stack issues
   - React Native component usage (not HTML)
   - Async/await patterns
   - TypeScript type mismatches

3. **Review Related Code**
   - Read the affected screen files
   - Check service layer (src/services/)
   - Review database queries
   - Check navigation setup

4. **Test the Fix**
   - Verify fix works in both profiles
   - Test edge cases
   - Make sure it doesn't break other features
   - Check console for any warnings

5. **Document**
   - Add comments if the fix is non-obvious
   - Update README if it was a known issue
