# Add New Feature

I want to add a new feature to the Expenses Made Easy app.

**Remember**: This is React Native/Expo, NOT Next.js!

## Requirements

Before implementing:
1. Read README.md for current project status
2. Use React Native components (View, Text, TouchableOpacity, etc.)
3. Follow existing patterns in src/screens/
4. Use StyleSheet.create() for styles
5. Make sure feature works with Business/Personal profile toggle
6. Add to navigation in AppNavigator.tsx if needed
7. Test on both Business and Personal modes

## Implementation Steps

1. **Review Existing Code**
   - Check similar features in the codebase
   - Understand the navigation structure
   - Review how Business/Personal filtering works

2. **Plan the Feature**
   - What screens are needed?
   - What database tables/queries?
   - How does it integrate with profiles?

3. **Implement**
   - Create screen files in src/screens/
   - Add navigation routes if needed
   - Create Supabase queries in services/
   - Add filtering by activeProfile if needed

4. **Test**
   - Works in Business mode
   - Works in Personal mode
   - Doesn't break existing features

5. **Document**
   - Update README.md if significant feature
   - Add comments in code

What feature would you like to add?
